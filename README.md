(Meteorology) meteorology agency wants an application that records the high and low temperatures for each day of all months of for the year 2010. 
The agency requests you to design the application using three-dimensional weather array by which the months, days and daily (low, high, average) temperatures represented. 
The months are labeled by the numbers 1 to 12, the date of the months are numbered 1 through 31 representing the days, and three columns labeled H and L, representing the day’s high, low and average temperatures. Use this information to develop a program that records the high and low temperatures for each day of all months and then allow the user to request the following:
 -Any day’s high and low temperature.
 -Any month high, low and average temperatures for a given month
 -Month and day with the highest temperature
 -Month and day with the lowest temperature.
 -All months average temperature to be printed in table format
